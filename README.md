# MO2 Master Order Checker Plugin

This is a very simple plugin for Mod Organizer 2 that scans your plugins list and checks if you have any plugins loading before their masters. If you do, MO2 will notify you about it.

Should work for any game that has plugins - Fallout 4, Skyrim, etc.

To install, just drop the master_order_checker.py file into your MO2's plugins folder.
